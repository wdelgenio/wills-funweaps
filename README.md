This is a gzdoom mod that alters all the weapons to make them much more powerful but still balanced.
Useful for playing difficult slaughtermaps without being overwhelmed, in particular the Chillax maps as they are very stingy with ammo.

## Weapons
All weapons have been altered, and almost all weapons have an alt fire that does something interesting.

### Fist
It's more powerful and faster.
Alt fire costs 30 cells and revives a nearby monster as a friend.  They'll help you attack other enemies.

### Pistol
It's extremely powerful but with a very slow fire rate now.
Alt fire uses 5 bullets but does a life steal.

### Railgun
Shotgun has been replaced by a railgun.  It'll shoot through many enemies at once.  Uses 5 cells per shot.
Alt fire shoots several slugs but is less powerful and doesn't penetrate as far.

### Super shotgun
The first weapon I modded.  It shoots 10x the pellets in a much bigger spread.  It also fires 2x as fast.
No alt fire yet.

### Chaingun
Behaves more like a chain-shotgun.
Alt fire is a rapidfire low power railgun

### Rocket Launcher
Fires a set of rockets that randomly wander around and home in on enemies when there is one.  Similar to the ROTT drunk missile.
Alt fire shoots a quick volley of super fast mini-rockets.

### Plasma Rifle
Primary fire is a rapid fire plasma shotgun.
Alt fire shoots a large plasma ball that goes through enemies all while spitting out mini plasma balls in a spiral.  Good for clearing rooms and hallways.  Has limited range

### BFG
Primary fire is similar to the regular BFG but the tracers are rail projectile that travel through enemies.  Prevents the case where monsters in front block all the BFG tracers from hitting monsters behind them.
Alt fire is a way OP giant plasma ball that rips through enemies and explodes with a radius that expands the farther the ball travels.
